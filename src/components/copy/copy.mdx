# Copy

Copies make common actions more obvious and help users more easily perform them. Buttons use labels and sometimes icons to communicate the action that will occur when the user touches them.

### Best practices

- Group copys logically into sets based on usage and importance.
- Ensure that copy actions are clear and consistent.
- The main action of a group set can be a primary copy.
- Select a single copy variation and do not mix them.

## Properties
